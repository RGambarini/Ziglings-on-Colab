# Ziglings-on-Colab
Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software. Ziglings are tiny broken programs written in zig that can be used to learn the language. This serves as an extension of the original repo https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings to provide a Google Colab notebook for the exercises
